# P-QoL
P-QoL, which stands for **Performance Quality-Of-Life**, is a simple Minecraft modpack for people who want to push **Minecraft optimization** onto its limit but also keep the Quality-Of-Life vibes throughout the gameplay, as well as a starting point for new Fabric users who are willing to see what equivalents Fabric has to offer to them.

*Or if you want some convincing representative cases for the topic: 'Forge + OptiFine is not always good like it sounds' 😏*

> TL;DR: Making your gameplay fancier, more enjoyable while still having the performance you expected.
# Before installing and applying the modpack
This modpack was made just for my personal use only, it might break some vanilla functions in Minecraft. With that being said, I can't guarantee that this modpack is **100% stable and bug-free**. If you have any problems while using this modpack, please file me [a new issue](https://github.com/Scarlaid/P-QoL/issues) and I will try to response as soon as possible :D
### This GitHub repository was propounded by [this dude](https://github.com/TypicalShavonne/)

# Installation Guide
Simple enough, here are some steps to install my modpack:
## Install Minecraft and Fabric
- Install Minecraft first (if you dont't have Minecraft installed then why are you here? 🤨)
- Download [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net) then install [Fabric v0.13.1](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
- Open your Minecraft launcher and check if the Fabric Loader profile is installed
## Find your installation folder (Mojang's Minecraft Launcher)
It may differ if you're using a different client implementation.
###### Windows
- Type `%appdata` in your File Explorer/search `%appdata`/Windows + R then type `%appdata%` then Enter
- Find the `.minecraft` folder, that will be where you Minecraft versions/data stored
###### Linux
- Go to the path `~/.minecraft` (the folder `.minecraft` in your home directory)
## Final steps
- Download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/Scarlaid/P-QoL/releases)
- Extract the file using your desired archiver, you will find yourself a `mods` folder.
- Move that `mods` folder into your Minecraft installation folder (`.minecraft`)
- Run the game with Fabric Mod Loader you just installed
- Gratz you made it, now enjoy the "no-lag", smooth-like-butter gameplay with QoL vibes 😎
### Optional suggestions
You can add some finishing touches onto your Minecraft installation. Keep in mind that these steps are all **optional**, and they may break functionalities in some occasions.
- Run Minecraft with [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads)
- Pair your Minecraft installation with these [**JVM Arguments**](https://pastebin.com/4piKwgCy)
# Included mods
This modpack was inspired from this [list of Optifine alternatives](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/), but it's doesn't mean it will stop there.
Here you can find the mods with any little detail about each of them, keep in mind that I only make this modpack for **only 1.18.1** so if you came here for modpacks that support versions lower than 1.18, unfortunately this is not the right place.
