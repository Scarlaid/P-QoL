# P-QoL
P-QoL, or in details, **Performance Quality-Of-Life** (yeah it's a weird name), is a simple modpack for people who have the curiousity of pushing the boundary of **Minecraft optimization** but also keeping the Quality-Of-Life vibes throughout the gameplay, as well as a starting point for any new Fabric users who are willing to see what equivalents Fabric has to offer to them (or somehow change their view about using Optifine and shift to Sodium)

> Simple definition for this modpack is making your gameplay more ideal, have the fancy view while still having the performance you want.
# Included mods
This modpack was inspired from this [list of Optifine alternatives](lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/),  but it's doesn't mean it will stop there.
Here you can find the mods with any little detail about each of them, keep in mind that I only make this modpack for **only 1.18.1** so if you came for modpacks that supports lower than 1.18, this is not the place.
### Perfromance
| Name | Author | Description | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------| 
| [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/releases) | [CaffeinMC](https://github.com/CaffeineMC) | Optimization mod for the Minecraft client that improves frame rates, reduces micro-stutter, and fixes graphical issues in Minecraft, as well as adds some graphics options | Doesn't have **all** the settings like Optifine |
| [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) | [CaffeinMC](https://github.com/CaffeineMC) | A mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide better overall performance | Works good for both for **client** and (or) **server**
| [Hydrogen](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/hydrogen-fabric) | [CaffeinMC](https://github.com/CaffeineMC) | Reduce the game's memory requirements by implementing more memory-efficient data structures and logic | Works good for both for **client** and (or) **server**, might break some mods
| [Starlight](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight) | [PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC) | Fabric mod for completely rewriting the Vanilla light engine | Incompatible with [Phosphor](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric), but a payback, better performance.
| [C2ME](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric) | [RelativityMC](https://github.com/RelativityMC) | C^2M-Engine, or C2ME for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel | Might be unstable for most Onboard GPU because of the intensive this mod offers
